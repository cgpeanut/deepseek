Predicting patterns from random numbers is a bit challenging due to the properties of randomness themselves. However, if you want to predict future sequences based on past ones, machine learning algorithms may be able to help with this task. Here's an example using a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in Python:

This script trains a simple LSTM model on your data and then uses it to make predictions about future sequences of numbers. The `create_dataset` function is used to prepare the data for input into our RNN, which expects input with this specific shape. 

Please note that you need to have TensorFlow installed in your Python environment. If it's not already installed, you can add it using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow
```
This is a very basic example and might not give the best predictions for all types of data or sequences. For more advanced use-cases, consider looking into more complex models like LSTMs or Transformers, or even more sophisticated techniques like GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).
